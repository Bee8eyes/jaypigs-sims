# Jaypigs_marketplace_sim
This document details everything about simulating Jaypigs model of fee distribution on the users.

The simulation code contains two scripts: **variables.py** and **sim_test.py**.

**variables.py** contains the variables used for the simulation.  
**sim_test.py** contains the code that runs the simulation based on the model explained below.

To simply run the simulations with the pre-set variables, pull the repository both scripts and execute **sim_test.py**.  
To run the simulation with customized variables you can change variables.py, save it, then execute **sim_test.py**.
 
##  Revenue Distribution model

Jaypigs distributs the fees revenue distribution model theory is explained here :

## Simulation results
The simulation simulates multiple users making sales on different intervals
### Prequisites:  

The simulation is made on the next assumptions:
- **Sale Volume**: All sales have the same volume. For the simulation below V=1 Avax.
- **Number of users**: It's fixed at 5 user. Each user makes a different number of transactions at random blocks. The number of transactions Users 1 to 5 made is respectively, 1,3,5,10,15 sales. 
- **Total duration**:  The total duration of the simulation is 100 blocks. The scale can be considered 1/100, so block Number N in the simulation refers to the block N*100 in real scale. 
- **Decay factor**: The Decay factor ```τ``` , determines how rapidly, the significance of a user's generated volume in a certain sale, decreases over time. More details about ```τ``` can be found in the [Decay factor impact](#real-cool-heading) section below. 



The current simulation contains three metrics that allow us to globally evaluate the performance of the platform over time.
### Results  
#### 1. **Total Weighted volume per user over time.**  
In order to compute a users share in the total fee pool, we need to compute the total volume a user owns, at any point of time, or per the simulation, at any block.

First, volumes in our calculation will be weighted. A weighted volume is an indicator that gives decreases over time, hence when calculating the total volume that a user generated, the latest volumes are much more relevant compared to old volumes. As a result, The sum of weighted volumes represents to a greater extent, the latest volume that a user have generated. 

We convert the generated volume per sale to the **weighted volume**, by multiplying it with a descending exponential function over time.    
The total **weighted volume** (WV) is simply the sum of all the **weighted volumes** the sales of a certain user have generated. More details are in the [Jaypigs Distribution model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4ypm2dvgnixfn0x/Jaypigs%20Revenue%20Sharing%20Model_v1.2.pdf?dl=0).

**Analysis:** for a certain user, the spikes corresponds to the moment that user made a sale. This volume declines over time if the user do not make any recent purchase. (Again, because each volume unit generated by a sale declines over time, so the sum of all volumes declines).  

If a user wants to keep his total weighted volume high over time he needs to constantly make sales, so each sale gives a boost to his total volume.

In the long run, the user with most recent sales (hence most volume) ends up winning the race to the highest volume, thus pool share.
  
#### 2. Pool share percentage of the fees per user over time.

The pool share percentage or PSP, represents the share of the user in the total fee pool, at each block. It varies over time due to the different sales user make. Users with most frequent recent sales will have a higher PSP than others.  

PSP Simulation result: 
![Pool share evolution per user](https://github.com/Bee8eyes/jaypigs-sims/blob/main/PSP.PNG)

**Analysis:** At block 1, user 3 had 100% of the pool share so he gets 100% of the fee the user after him generated. But after few block, other users made few sales so the ones that did that, have now a share in the fee pool. 

In the long run, the user with most recent sales ends up having a bigger pool share than others. However all users have a fair share of the pie according to their total recent volume.

#### 3. Balance per user over time.

The balance represents how much fees were collected by each user at any point of time.  

Balance Simulation result:
![Balance evolution per user](https://github.com/Bee8eyes/jaypigs-sims/blob/main/Balance.PNG)  

**Analysis:** The balance chart is explicit. The revenues generated by the platform (for every sale) are distributed according to the pool share percentage for each user. Once a transaction has been made. All users receive a portion of the fee. Each time there's a raise in users balance, it means that in that specific block a sale has been made by one of them.

## Decay factor impact
```τ``` controls the descent rate of the weighted volume. The bigger ```τ``` is the slower the descent and vice versa. If ```τ``` is too low then only the very recent volumes are taken into account to calculate the user share of the pool. If ```τ``` is too high the rate of descent is so slow to the point it becomes almost constant(it will eventually go to 0, but that will take much longer).

Here are two examples:

```τ=10000```:  
![Big tau](https://github.com/Bee8eyes/jaypigs-sims/blob/main/big_tau.PNG)  

```τ=0.5``` :  
![small tau](https://github.com/Bee8eyes/jaypigs-sims/blob/main/small_tau.PNG) 

The Impact on the final balance of the users is insignificant. The weighted volumes for all users decay at the same rate so it kind of cancels out (same decrease applied to everyone).
The Impact can be seen within someone who makes successive sales for a certain period of time will eventually keep win of the fees because the volumes of other users is decreasing rapidly unless they constantly make sales. 

Conclusion: The decay factor should be determined based on how rapidly we want the volumes significance to decrease. In the future this variables will be dynamic based on the number of the users on the platform and will be deeply studied.
